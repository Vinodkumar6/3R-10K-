        <p>
            <b>Monkey D. Luffy</b> also known as <strong><i><q>Straw Hat</q> Luffy</i></strong>, is a fictional character and the protagonist in the Japanese manga series One Piece created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut as a young boy who acquires the
            properties of rubber after accidentally eating one of the Devil Fruits that belonged to <q>Red Hair</q> <mark>Shanks</mark>.
Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and dreamt of being a pirate since childhood from the influence of his idol and mentor Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, 
Luffy sets sail from the <small><b><i><u>East Blue Sea</u></i></b></small> to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed <mark><b>Gol D. Roger</b></mark> as <q><u><b><i>King of the Pirates</i></b></u></q>.
He fights multiple antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious and even aggressive when he fights. Luffy uses his rubber body to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks. 
In his signature attack, the <i><b>Gum-Gum Pistol</b></i>, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance. Luffy also 
grows stronger over the course of the story by transforming his body through different "Gears;" this is reflected in his bounty, which is used to measure the threat he poses to the World Government. He is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, who is a vice-admiral of the Navy; the son of Monkey D. Dragon,
 who is the leader of the <strong><i><del>Revolutionary Army</del></i></strong> and sworn brother of Portgas D. Ace and Sabo.
Luffy appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials, and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations and several of the franchise's video games. He is the only character in One Piece who appears in every story arc of the series. Due to the series' international popularity,
 Luffy is one of the world's most recognizable manga and anime characters. In addition to the One Piece franchise, the character appears in a number of manga and anime series and collaborative video games. His critical reception is largely positive.<br>
