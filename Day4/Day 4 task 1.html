        <p>Naruto Uzumaki  is the titular protagonist of the manga Naruto, created 
            by Masashi Kishimoto. He is a ninja from the fictional Hidden Leaf Village . As a boy, Naruto 
            is ridiculed and ostracized on account of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox—a malevolent creature that attacked Konohagakure—that was sealed away in his body.
             Despite this, he aspires to become his village's leader, the Hokage, in order to receive their approval. His carefree, optimistic, and boisterous 
             personality enables him to befriend other Konohagakure ninja, as well as ninja from other villages. Naruto appears in the series' films and in other 
             media related to the franchise, including video games and original video animations ,
             as well as the sequel Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, where he is the Hokage, and his son, Boruto Uzumaki, is the protagonist.</p>

    <p>Minato entered Konoha's Academy with the dream of earning the villagers' respect and recognition by becoming Hokage.[1] When Kushina Uzumaki 
        moved to Konoha, she was placed in the same class as Minato. Minato was immediately drawn to her bright red hair, finding it beautiful. Minato
         was a natural prodigy as a ninja, the likes of which appears only once in a generation.[2] When he was added to a genin team under the leadership 
         of Jiraiya, Jiraiya took a special interest in Minato and took him on as his apprentice, teaching him many of his own signature abilities. In time,
         Minato's exceptional skills led Jiraiya to believe he might be the Child of the Prophecy, someone who would someday save the world.</p>

    <p>Madara Uchiha  is a main antagonist manga and anime character in the Naruto series created by Masashi Kishimoto. 
        He appears for the first time in "Part II" of the manga and the Shippuden anime adaptation, as a major antagonist. He, along with its first Hokage Hashirama Senju,
         is one of the co-founders of Konohagakure (Japanese: 木ノ葉隠れの里, Hepburn: Konohagakure no Sato) village from the ninja world. Their power conflict over how to run
          the village, as well as the long-term feud between clans, leads to Madara's death. However, it is revealed later that Madara had used a man named Obito Uchiha as his agent.
           He transplants his Rinnegan  eye power into a child named Nagato, a member of the terrorist organization Akatsuki, to be preserved for his 
           eventual revival years later. During most of the series, Obito uses Madara's name until a criminal named Kabuto Yakushi reanimates the real Madara who becomes one of the
            primary antagonists alongside Obito Uchiha during the Fourth Great Shinobi World War storyline. Madara has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, including a Boruto feature film. 
        Many Naruto video games have featured him as a playable character.</p>
