        <p>Ichigo Kurosaki is a fictional character in the Bleach manga series and its adaptations 
            created by author Tite Kubo. He is the main protagonist of the series, who receives Soul Reaper powers after meeting Rukia Kuchiki, 
            a Soul Reaper assigned to patrol around the fictional city of Karakura Town. These powers come at the cost of her own, and as a result,
             he concedes to work as her stand-in, fighting to protect people from evil spirits called Hollows and sending good spirits, wholes, to 
             a dimension known as the Soul Society. Ichigo appears in other media after the manga series, including the anime television series,
              four anime films, two original video animations, rock musicals, several video games, light novels and the 2018 live-action film.
            Kubo said that Ichigo was created to replace Rukia as the protagonist of the series, because he felt she was unsuited for the role.
             In the anime series adaptation, Ichigo is voiced by Masakazu Morita in Japanese.[1] In the English dubbing, he is voiced by Johnny 
             Yong Bosch.[3] In the live-action film, he is played by Sota Fukushi.[5]</p>

    <p>Kenpachi has a wild and aggressive appearance, fitting with his personality. He wears his captain's jacket without sleeves, and with a more 
        ragged look to it. He acquired his Haori from the previous 11th Division captain, whom he defeated and killed in a duel in order to become captain. 
        He styles his hair into liberty spikes with bells at the tips, which, Tite Kubo has remarked, makes his hair one of the most difficult to draw in the 
        series.[1] He also wears a special eyepatch on his right eye lined with a strange creatures mouths; the eyepatch was created by the 12th Division.
         It absorbs the bulk of his power. Both of these are meant to give enemies an advantage, similar to his habit of fighting one-handed, since in an 
         unhandicapped state he would defeat them so quickly that he would not be able to enjoy himself sufficiently to delve into a state of bloodlust, 
         that being what he treasures most. He has a huge scar on the left side of his face, which was given to him as a child from his first ever battle with Retsu Unohana.</p>

    <p>Madara Uchiha  is a main antagonist manga and anime character in the Naruto series created by Masashi Kishimoto. 
        He appears for the first time in "Part II" of the manga and the Shippuden anime adaptation, as a major antagonist. He, along with its first Hokage Hashirama Senju,
         is one of the co-founders of Konohagakure (Japanese: 木ノ葉隠れの里, Hepburn: Konohagakure no Sato) village from the ninja world. Their power conflict over how to run
          the village, as well as the long-term feud between clans, leads to Madara's death. However, it is revealed later that Madara had used a man named Obito Uchiha as his agent.
           He transplants his Rinnegan  eye power into a child named Nagato, a member of the terrorist organization Akatsuki, to be preserved for his 
           eventual revival years later. During most of the series, Obito uses Madara's name until a criminal named Kabuto Yakushi reanimates the real Madara who becomes one of the
            primary antagonists alongside Obito Uchiha during the Fourth Great Shinobi World War storyline. Madara has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, including a Boruto feature film. 
        Many Naruto video games have featured him as a playable character.</p>
