        <p>Monkey D. Luffy , also known as "Straw Hat" Luffy[n 2], is a fictional character and the protagonist in the Japanese manga series One Piece 
            created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut as a young boy who acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating one of the Devil Fruits that belonged to "Red Hair" Shanks.

            Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and dreamt of being a pirate since childhood from the influence of his idol and mentor Red-Haired Shanks. 
            At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as "King of the Pirates".
            
            He fights multiple antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious and even aggressive
             when he fights. Luffy uses his rubber body to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks. In his signature attack, the Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches 
             at opponents from a distance. Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story by transforming his body through different "Gears;" this is reflected in his bounty, 
             which is used to measure the threat he poses to the World Government. He is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, who is a vice-admiral of the Navy; the son of Monkey D. Dragon,
              who is the leader of the Revolutionary Army;[10] and sworn brother of Portgas D. Ace and Sabo.[11]</p>

    <p>Roronoa Zoro (ロロノア・ゾロ, Roronoa Zoro, spelled as "Roronoa Zolo" in some English adaptations), also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro , 
        is a fictional character created by Japanese manga artist Eiichiro Oda who appears in the manga series and media franchise One Piece. He first appeared
        in the third chapter of the One Piece manga, published in the manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1997. Zoro is the first crewmate to join Monkey D. Luffy 
        to be part of his crew of pirates, after he is rescued by Luffy from execution. Zoro is a highly skilled swordsman and serves as the crew's combatant,[a]
         though he possesses an extremely poor sense of direction which recurs as a running gag throughout the series.</p>

    <p>Shanks, also known as "Red-Haired Shanks" , is one of the overarching protagonists of the 
        One Piece franchise. He is a legendary and powerful pirate in the Grand Line, being the chief of the Red Haired Pirates and one of the Four Emperors residing at the second half of
         the Grand Line the New World. With a standing bounty of 4,048,900,000 berries, he is one of the most wanted pirates in history.
        He is Monkey D. Luffy's childhood hero and a former apprentice of the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, alongside Buggy. He used to be a rival of "Hawkeye"
         Dracule Mihawk (who gave up all of his interests to fight Shanks due to him losing his arm). He is also the adoptive father of the World Greatest Diva
          Uta. He is greatly respected and feared by Pirates and Marines alike in the One Piece world.
         This is despite him having a 'soft' and easy-going nature, rarely seen directly involving himself in actual combat.</p>
